title: "Entropy Maximization for Anomaly Detection in Complex Driving Scenes Using a UNet Architecture"
excerpt: "This project trained deep learning segmentation models to detect out-of-distribution objects in driving scenes using entropy maximization. Real-world scenarios often feature classes not included in training datasets. To detect these objects, I implemented entropy maximization, which modifies the standard cross-entropy loss function to boost the model's prediction entropy for out-of-distribution objects. A U-Net model was trained using this modified loss function and compared to baseline models. The results indicate a substantial improvement in the anomaly detection capability of the U-Net model, with a significant increase in segmentation metrics like AUROC and AUPRC and a decrease in FPR95.
