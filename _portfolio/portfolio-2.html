title: "Entropy Maximization for Anomaly Detection in Complex Driving Scenes Using a UNet Architecture"
excerpt: "The objective of this project was to train deep learning segmentation models to detect out-of-distribution objects in complex driving scenes through entropy maximization. Semantic segmentation models are typically trained on a fixed set of classes, yet real-world scenarios often feature classes not included in many training datasets, such as Cityscapes. A thorough literature review of state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods was performed, leading to the selection of entropy maximization. This approach modifies the standard cross-entropy loss function to boost the model's prediction entropy for out-of-distribution objects. A standard U-Net model was trained using this modified loss function and its performance was compared to the DeepLabV3+ model used by the original authors. The results indicate a substantial improvement in the anomaly detection capability of the U-Net model compared to the DeepLabV3+, with an AUROC increase of 12.0%, a 61.5% decrease in FPR95, and a 379.9% increase in AUPRC. <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"

This work was done during my great exchange semester at the University of Rhode Island, USA in the 'Algorithms for Big Data' course taught by Professor Noah Daniels. You can find a link to the paper [here](http://academicpages.github.io/files/paper1.pdf) and currently I am working on refactoring and publishing the code for this project.
