title: "Entropy Maximization for Anomaly Detection in Complex Driving Scenes Using a UNet Architecture"
excerpt: "The objective of this project was to train deep learning segmentation models to detect out-of-distribution objects in complex driving scenes through entropy maximization. Semantic segmentation models are typically trained on a fixed set of classes, yet real-world scenarios often feature classes not included in many training datasets, such as Cityscapes. A thorough literature review of state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods was performed, leading to the selection of entropy maximization. This approach modifies the standard cross-entropy loss function to boost the model's prediction entropy for out-of-distribution objects. A standard U-Net model was trained using this modified loss function and its performance was compared to the DeepLabV3+ model used by the original authors. The results indicate a substantial improvement in the anomaly detection capability of the U-Net model compared to the DeepLabV3+, with an AUROC increase of 12.0%, a 61.5% decrease in FPR95, and a 379.9% increase in AUPRC. <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
