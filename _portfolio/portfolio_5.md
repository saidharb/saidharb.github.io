title: "PC2Model: LiDAR simulation for ISPRS benchmark dataset"
excerpt: "Developed and curated a point cloud to 3D model registration dataset within a small team. Investigated multiple 3D model datasets to select samples. Created a Python Blender add-on to interface with the Helios++ laser-scanning simulation software and conducted simulations of objects and buildings. Co-authored the paper for the dataset for submission to ISPRS Toronto 2026 and gained hands-on experience with real LiDAR scanners.
